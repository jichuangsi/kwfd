I'm pleased to announce PDFObject 2.0 has arrived! Completely rewritten for the HTML5 era, PDFObject 2.0 has **BREAKING CHANGES** and is not backwards-compatible.

For examples, instructions, and a general good time, check out the recently updated http://pdfobject.com

I have completed initial testing in IE9-11, MS Edge, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and iOS Safari. PDF embedding is not supported by Safari in iOS -- it is not a PDFObject shortcoming!

If you find any issues, please report them at https://github.com/pipwerks/PDFObject/issues.
